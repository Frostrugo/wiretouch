###Building
We are currently using Xcode 6.1 on OSX 10.10 for development. To successully build the Xcode project you will have to download   
[openFrameworks]https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks 0.8.4. You will also have to download the following openFramework addons and place them in your openFrameworks addon directory.

* ofxUI: https://github.com/rezaali/ofxUI
* ofxBlobsManager: https://github.com/peteruithoven/ofxBlobsManager
* ofxCv: https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv

We are also using several other 3rd-party libraries. You do not have to download them manually as they already reside in the src/3rd-party directory. This list is just for future reference and to give credit where credit is due:
* cjson: http://cjson.sourceforge.net/
* TUIO C++ library: http://reactivision.sourceforge.net
* oscpack: http://code.google.com/p/oscpack/
